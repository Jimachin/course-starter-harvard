    "description": "Welcome to Introduction to Data Science. The course focuses on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. The class material integrates the five key facets of an investigation using data: data collection ‐ data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; data management ‐ accessing data quickly and reliably; exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; prediction or statistical learning; and communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.",
